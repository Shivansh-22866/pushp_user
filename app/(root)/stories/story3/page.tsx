            Sushila Mahato, a skilled Dokra artist from the Bankura district of West Bengal, has been practicing this ancient lost-wax metal casting technique for over two decades. Her journey in Dokra art began as a family tradition, passed down through generations.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Dokra, also known as Dhokra, is a 4000-year-old art form that produces intricate non-ferrous metal sculptures using the lost-wax casting technique. Sushila specializes in creating both traditional tribal figurines and contemporary designs, bridging the gap between ancient craft and modern aesthetics.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Despite the challenges of maintaining this labor-intensive craft in the age of mass production, Sushila has become a beacon of hope for the Dokra community, inspiring younger artisans to continue this rich cultural heritage.
