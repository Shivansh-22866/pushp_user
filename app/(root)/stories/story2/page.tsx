            Ghulam Hassan, a master Pashmina weaver from Srinagar, Kashmir, has dedicated his life to preserving and promoting the art of Pashmina weaving. With over 40 years of experience, Ghulam&apos;s journey in this delicate craft began as an apprentice to his father at the age of 12.

            Pashmina, known for its exceptional softness and warmth, is derived from the undercoat of Changthangi goats found in the high altitudes of Ladakh. Ghulam&apos;s expertise lies in hand-spinning and weaving this fine wool into exquisite shawls, stoles, and scarves.

            Despite facing challenges from machine-made imitations, Ghulam continues to champion traditional hand-weaving techniques, ensuring the authenticity and quality of true Pashmina products.
